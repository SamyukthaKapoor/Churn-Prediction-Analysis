### Project Overview

**Husky Climaters** is a comprehensive project developed for the MIT Hackathon organized by Global Energy Monitor. This project aims to analyze and visualize global energy generation data, assess the health impacts of wind dispersion on populations, and provide a job portal for power plant-related opportunities. The project leverages data analytics, machine learning, and web development techniques to offer actionable insights and solutions in the energy sector.

### Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of global energy generation data. Key features include:

- **Filters for Power Plant Types, Country, and Energy Levels**: Customize your view by selecting different parameters.
- **Language Options**: Metadata conversion available in various languages for broader accessibility.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Designed for all audiences with alternate text and color coding for clarity.

#### Limitations
- **Location Filter**: Currently under development.
- **Live Data Integration**: Presently, the dashboard does not support live data but can be adapted for continuous data flow.

### Job Portal

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, the job portal is focused on energy sector employment opportunities. Key functionalities include:

- **Search and Filter Techniques**: Enhanced querying techniques for precise job searches.
- **Privacy Restrictions**: Ensures user data privacy and secure job search.

#### Example Job Search Queries
- Basic: `"power plant jobs" + "global"`
- Refined: `"renewable energy jobs" + "power plants" + "Asia"`

### Machine Learning Model for Health Impact Assessment

The machine learning model aims to assess the health impacts of wind dispersion based on emissions, wind speed, and population data. 

#### Key Features
- **Variables**: Emission data, wind speed, population statistics.
- **Health Impact Calculation**: Uses the Exposure-Response relationship to predict potential health impacts.

#### Conclusion
Wind dispersion and population density significantly influence health impacts. This model can be fine-tuned to predict diseases such as cancer and respiratory issues caused by pollution.
